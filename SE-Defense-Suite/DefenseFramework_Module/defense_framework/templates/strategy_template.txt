Corporate Social Engineering Defense Strategy
===============================================

1. Executive Summary
--------------------
This document outlines a complete corporate defense strategy against
social engineering attacks, including:
- 5x5 risk assessment
- ISO 27001 Annex A control mapping
- NIST SP 800-53 control mapping
- CIS Controls v8 best practices
- Human-factor mitigation and awareness strategy

This strategy was prepared to support the organization’s efforts in
strengthening resilience against phishing, pretexting, baiting, and
other manipulation-based cyber threats.

2. Risk Matrix Overview
-----------------------
The following matrix evaluates social engineering risks based on:

Likelihood:
1 = Rare
2 = Unlikely
3 = Possible
4 = Likely
5 = Almost Certain

Impact:
1 = Negligible
2 = Minor
3 = Moderate
4 = Major
5 = Critical

Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact

Score Interpretation:
1–5:     Low
6–12:    Medium
15–20:   High
21–25:   Critical

This module dynamically generates the organization’s risk rating based
on specific social engineering threat scenarios.

3. ISO 27001 Annex A Controls
-----------------------------
Relevant Annex A controls include:

A.5 – Information Security Policies  
A.6 – Organization of Information Security  
A.7 – Human Resource Security  
A.9 – Access Control  
A.12 – Operations Security  
A.13 – Communications Security  
A.16 – Incident Management  
A.18 – Compliance  

These controls are mapped automatically within the framework.

4. NIST SP 800-53 Control Families
----------------------------------
The framework integrates recommended controls from:

- AT (Awareness and Training)
- AC (Access Control)
- IR (Incident Response)
- AU (Audit and Accountability)
- CA (Security Assessment)
- PM (Program Management)
- PS (Personnel Security)

These controls enhance resilience against human-based attacks.

5. CIS Controls v8 Mapping
--------------------------
The system includes recommendations from CIS Controls:

1. Inventory and Control of Assets  
2. Data Protection  
3. Secure Configuration  
4. Email and Browser Protections  
5. Account Management  
6. Security Awareness and Skills Train
